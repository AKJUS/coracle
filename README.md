# What is this?

Coracle is a web client for the Nostr protocol. While Nostr is useful for many things, Coracle focuses on providing a high-quality social media experience. Check it out at [coracle.social](https://coracle.social).

[Dufflepud](https://github.com/staab/dufflepud) is a companion server which you can self-host. It helps Coracle with things like link previews and image uploads.

Coracle is currently in _alpha_ - expect bugs, slow loading times, and rough edges.

If you like Coracle and want to support its development, you can donate sats via [Geyser](https://geyser.fund/project/coracle).
